== Description

*This application designed to run in single instance mode.*


[.underline]#The database contains:#

* one job of type 'EMAIL' in the state 'QUEUED'
* one schedule for the job of type 'INDEXING' with cron '0/55 * * * * ?' (run every 55 sec)

[.underline]#For testing purposes configured 3 types of business jobs:#

* *EMAIL* - simulates sending e-mail (taking 300 milliseconds)
* *DWH* - simulates data loading (taking 10 seconds, an error occurs in half starts)
* *INDEXING* - simulates indexing operation (taking 42 seconds)

[.underline]#Web controller responses:#

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.

| `400 BAD REQUEST`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
